            <p><b>Descirption : </b>In computer science, a cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency that does not rely on any central authority to uphold or maintain it. Instead, transaction and ownership data is stored in a digital ledge using distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain. However, when a cryptocurrency is issued by a single issuer or minted or created prior to issuance, it is generally considered centralized.
                Despite the name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies</p>
